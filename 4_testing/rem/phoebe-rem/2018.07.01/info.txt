Dataset is split into two sub-datasets called folders and each folder has one training dataset and testing dataset. Training dataset is named sample{i}.base and testing dataset is named sample{i}.test. There are two sub-training datasets and two sub-testing datasets.
- sample1.base
- sample1.test
- sample2.base
- sample2.base

Each training dataset is made sparse with sparse ratios (for example, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) into missing (incomplete) training datasets. Each missing training dataset is named sample{i}.base.{sparse-ratio}.miss. There are 8 missing training datasets:
- sample1.base.0.2.miss
- sample2.base.0.2.miss
- sample1.base.0.4.miss
- sample2.base.0.4.miss
- sample1.base.0.6.miss
- sample2.base.0.6.miss
- sample1.base.0.8.miss
- sample2.base.0.8.miss

Testing regression expectation maximization algorithm, called REM algorithm with regard to 8 pairs of missing training datasets and testing datasets as follows:
- sample1.base.0.2.miss / sample1.test
- sample2.base.0.2.miss / sample2.test
- sample1.base.0.4.miss / sample1.test
- sample2.base.0.4.miss / sample2.test
- sample1.base.0.6.miss / sample1.test
- sample2.base.0.6.miss / sample2.test
- sample1.base.0.8.miss / sample1.test
- sample2.base.0.8.miss / sample2.test
